Backend code for Cloud Resume Challenge
This project-based approach solidifies learning by mirroring real-world scenarios. Participants create a cloud-hosted resume using services like object storage, a NoSQL database, and an API gateway, while employing Infrastructure as Code tools and CI/CD pipelines. This challenge not only demonstrates technical skills but also provides experience in cloud architecture, security, and DevOps practices.
